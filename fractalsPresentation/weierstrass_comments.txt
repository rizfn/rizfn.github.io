"f enough years and powers are left to me I shall show to the mathematical world that
not only geometry but also algebra can show analysis the ways and certainly the stronger
ones. If I cannot do that, then those will do it who shall come after me and, moreover, they
will realize the incorrectness of all these reasonings, used today by the so-called analysis" - Kronecker, 1884
